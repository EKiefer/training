As a prerequisite, operators need to understand how the following math concepts:\n\n\n\n\naddition  \n\n\nsubtraction  \n\n\nmultiplication  \n\n\ndivision  \n\n\n\n\nOperators also need to understand the following concepts:\n\n\n\n\nfractions  \n\n\nstatistics  \n\n\nunit analysis  \n\n\nconversion between fractions and decimal equivalent  \n\n\nrounding  \n\n\narea  \n\n\nvolume  \n\n\nrates\n\n\n\n\nFractions\n\n\nThere are many cases when operators need to work with fractions. For instance, when dealing with flow rates, operators need to remember that a flow rate such as 3.0 million gallons per day (MGD) can be written as a fraction:  \n\n\n\n\n3.0 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day}\n\n\n\n\nThis is useful to know if you are trying to add flow rates when units are not equivalent. For example, let's say you want to add 300 gallons per minute (GPM) to 3.0 MGD.  \n\n\n\n\n300 \\frac {Gallons}{Minute} + 3.0 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day}\n\n\n\n\nAs it is written, you cannot add these 2 fractions until you convert the units so that the units are the same. We'll come back to solving this at the very \nend of the module\n.  \n\n\nAdding and Subtracting\n\n\nWhen the units are the same, you can proceed with basic math operations. Let's assume you are able to get the units the same, now what? Consider the following expression:\n\n\n\n\n\\frac {1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, you cannot proceed until you get convert the fraction(s) so that the denominator is the same. In case you are not familiar with the term \"denominator,\" see the following figure.\n\n\n\n\n\\frac {numerator}{denominator}\n\n\n\n\nGetting back to our simple example, here is how you would proceed. \n\n\n\n\nMultiply the numerator and denominator of one of the fractions by the same amount to get an equivalent fraction--so that the equivalent fraction has the same denominator as the other fraction.\n\n\nAdd the numerators together.\n\n\nNote: do NOT add the demoninators!\n\n\n\n\nIn this case:\n\n\n\n\n\\frac {1}{2} \\times \\left(\\frac {2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{4}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\frac {2}{4} + \\frac {1}{4} = \\frac {3}{4}\n\n\n\n\nMultiplying and Dividing\n\n\nWhen multiplying and dividing, you proceed in the following manner:  \n\n\n\n\n\\frac {a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac {a \\times c}{b \\times d}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\frac {a}{b} \\div \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac {a}{b} \\times \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac {a \\times d}{b \\times c}\n\n\n\n\nUsing numbers instead of variable, consider the following expression:\n\n\n\n\n\\frac {2}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac {2 \\times 4}{3 \\times 7} = \\frac {8}{21}\n\n\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nFor more information, visit this \nKhan Academy website.\n\n\nStatistics\n\n\nStatistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In applying statistics to operations, we first need to select the applicable data and the select the statistical model.\n\n\nIn most cases, we select all of the measurements (i.e. chlorine residual) taken over the course of the day and run the basic analyses:\n\n\n\n\nAverage (mean)  \n\n\nMax  \n\n\nMin  \n\n\nRange  \n\n\n\n\nAverage\n\n\nTo determine the average, add up all of the values to determine the sum. Divide the sum of values by the number of samples to get the average.\n\n\nFor instance, let's say you have the following chlorine residuals.\n\n\n\n\n(2.1, 2.5, 2.3, 2.7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSum\\,of\\,Values = 2.1 + 2.5 + 2.3 + 2.7 = 9.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\\,of\\,Samples = 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage = \\frac {Sum\\,of\\,Values}{Number\\,of\\,Samples} = \\frac {9.6}{4} = 2.4\n\n\n\n\nMax\n\n\nThe max is the greatest value in a collection of measurements.\n\n\n\n\nMax = 2.7\n\n\n\n\nMin\n\n\nThe min is the smallest value in a collection of measurements.\n\n\n\n\nMin = 2.1\n\n\n\n\nRange\n\n\nRange is the difference between the max and the min.\n\n\nUse the numbers in this section:\n\n\n\n\nRange = Max - Min = 2.7 - 2.1 = 0.6\n\n\n\n\nUnit Analysis\n\n\nIt is important to understand units and how they apply to measurements and observations. For instance, a measurement of 2.3 ppm of free chlorine residual can be expressed as the following:\n\n\n\n\n2.3 \\frac {part}{million\\,parts}\n\n\n\n\nor equivalently:\n\n\n\n\n2.3 \\frac {milligrams}{liter}\n\n\n\n\nNote: one \"part\" is a milligram. There are 1000 milligrams (mg) in a gram. Water weighs 1 gram (g) per milliliter. There are a thousand milliliters (mL) in a liter (L). Look at the following derivation.\n\n\n\n\n\\require{cancel}\n\n\n\\frac{mg}{L} = \\frac{mg}{\\cancel L} \\times \\frac{\\cancel L}{1000 \\cancel {mL}} \\times \\frac{\\cancel {ml}}{\\cancel g} \\times \\frac{\\cancel g}{1000 mg}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\frac{mg}{L} = \\frac {mg}{1000 \\times 1000\\,mg} = \\frac{mg}{1,000,000 mg} = \\frac {part}{million\\,parts}\n\n\n\n\nNote: This assumes that 1 mL equals 1 g. This is true for pure water. You can make this assumption for any chemical... just note that as you get closer to a pure chemical, this assumption fails.\n  \n\n\nUnit analysis is important when you need to convert units. For example, if you a pump running at 1000 gallons per minute (GPM), you need unit analysis to convert GPM to MGD.  \n\n\nConversion Between Fractions and Decimal Equivalent\n\n\nEvery fraction can be expressed as a decimal, and vice versa. For example, take the number 0.125.\n\n\n\n\n0.125 = \\frac{125}{1000} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\n\n\nand take the fraction \n5/16\n:\n\n\n\\frac {5}{16} = 0.3125\n\n\n\n\nRounding\n\n\nNumbers in base 10 (the numbers we are used to using) are composed of digits that represent different values of 10. Look at the following number: \n\n\n\n\n124.17\n\n\n\\underline{hundreds}\\,\\underline{tens}\\,\\underline{ones}\\,. \\underline {tenths}\\,\\underline {hundredths}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you round to the nearest tenth, the answer is \n124.2\n.  \n\n\nIf you round to the nearest ten, the answer is \n120\n.  \n\n\nIf you round to the nearest hundred, the answer is \n100\n.  \n\n\n\n\nAfter you identify what digit you are rounding to, you look at the next digit (to the right) and determine if that number is 5 or more. If the answer is yes, then you increase the digit you are rounding to by one... and you drop all of the digits to the right. If NOT, then you don't change that digit and you drop all of the digits to the right.\n\n\nArea\n\n\nArea allows us to better describe and measure 2 dimensional shapes. For instance, the area of a rectangle is the length multiplied by width. If this rectangle represents a wall, knowing the area could tell us how much paint is required to cover it.   \n\n\nClick here for more information about area.\n.  \n\n\nVolume\n\n\nVolume allows us to better describe and measure properties of 3 dimensional shapes. Volume is very relevant to the treatment process; we are constantly monitoring the volume of various liquids that are stored in our tanks.\n\n\nIn most cases, we would need to measure volume if we needed to determine how many gallons of water will fit in a rectangular chamber. In this case:\n\n\n\n\nVolume=Length \\times Width \\times Height\n\n\n\n\nTo convert from volume in cubic feet to gallons, use the following conversion:\n\n\n\n\n7.48\\,gallons = 1\\,cubic\\,foot\n\n\n\n\nFinal Words\n\n\nLet's go back to this problem:\n\n\n\n\n300 \\frac {Gallons}{Minute} + 3.0 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day}\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to get the units to match up.\n\n\n\n\n300 \\frac {\\cancel {Gallons}}{\\cancel {Minute}} \\times \\frac {1 Million\\,Gallons}{1,000,000 \\cancel {Gallons}} \\times \\frac {1,440 \\cancel {Minutes}}{Day} =\n\n\n0.432 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day}\n\n\n\n\nThen the fractions need to be added.\n\n\n\n\n0.432 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day} + 3.0 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day} =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.432 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day}\n\n\n\n\n*Note: In Operator Chemistry we discuss significant digits. This number should be reported as 3.4 MGD if we take significant digits into consideration.",

It is important to understand the basic properties of these chemicals so that you can safely handle them and predict how they will react with other chemicals.\n\n\nAcids have a pH below 7. Bases have a pH above 7. Typically, most chemicals or solutions will have a pH within the range of 0 to 14.\n\n\\require{mhchem}\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can discuss the meaning of pH, you must first understand some chemical properties of water (\n\\ce{H2O}\n). One of them is that water is in equilibrium with hydronium and hydroxyl ions depicted in the reaction shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\\ce{H2O_{(l)} \\rightleftharpoons H^+_{(aq)} + OH^{-}_{(aq)}}\n\n\n\n\nNote: \nH^+\n is shorthand for \n\\ce{H3O^+}\n.

This means that water is dynamic; it is constantly converting between water and its parts. Other chemicals behave in the same manner.\n\n\nYou can measure how many \nH^+\n are in solution. This is typically done with several electrodes. In the probe shown in the image below, there is both a reference electrode and a pH electrode. The pH electrode has a glass bulb and is inserted into the solution that needs to be measured. The reference electrode is inside the body of the probe.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you insert the pH probe into a solution, an electrial potential will develop across the pH electrode (outside electrode vs inside electrode). The more \nH^+\n ions in solution, the greater the potential. When you compare this potential to the potential of the reference electrode, you can determine how many \nH^+\n ions are in solution. As it turns out, the relationship between potential and pH is -59.18 mV/pH.\n\n\nSo, what exactly is pH? \n\n\nWhen you measure pH, you are measuring the concentration of \nH^+\n ions. However, there are a wide range of \nH^+\n ions that are typically observed. Instead of reporting a value of 0.0000007 moles / L or 0.1 moles / L of hydronium ions, is more convient to use the log of concentration.\n\n\n\n\npH = -log\\ce{[H^{+}]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npH\n\n\n\n\n\\ce{[H^{+}]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n0.00001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n0.000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n0.0000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n0.00000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n0.000000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.0000000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n0.00000000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.000000000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n0.0000000000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n0.00000000000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing the pH by 1, decreases the concentration of hydronium ions by a factor of 10.   \n\n\nFor more information about what \"log\" means, visit the \nKahn Academy website\n.\n\n\nFor more information about acids, bases, and pH, visit the following \nKahn Academy video\n.

You need to be careful when you work with numbers of different precisions.  \n\n\nFor instances, let's say you want to add a very precise number (i.e. 2004.214 g) to a number of low precision (i.e. 2000 g). How do you report the sum? \n\n\nBefore we can answer that, you need to understand significant digits.\n\n\nSignificant Digits\n\n\nThere are three rules on determining how many significant figures are in a number:\n\n\n\n\nNon-zero digits are always significant.  \n\n\nAny zeros between two significant digits are significant.  \n\n\nA final zero or trailing zeros in the decimal portion ONLY are significant.\n\n\n\n\nPlease remember that, in science, all numbers are based upon measurements (except for a very few that are defined). Since all measurements are uncertain, we must only use those numbers that are meaningful.  A common ruler cannot measure something to be 22.4072643 cm long. Not all of the digits have meaning (significance) and, therefore, should not be written down. In science, only the numbers that have significance (derived from measurement) are written.\n\n\nAdding and Subtracting\n\n\nFor addition and subtraction, look at the decimal portion (i.e., to the right of the decimal point) of the numbers ONLY. Here is what to do:\n\n\n1) Count the number of significant figures in the decimal portion of each number in the problem. (The digits to the left of the decimal place are not used to determine the number of decimal places in the final answer.)\n\n\n2) Add or subtract in the normal fashion.\n\n\n3) Round the answer to the LEAST number of places in the decimal portion of any number in the problem. \n\n\nExample: What is the sum of 2.25 and 0.025?\n\n\nWhile it is true the sum is 2.275, the value should reflect the reliability of the least precise operation. The answer should be reported as 2.28. \n\n\nMultiplying and Dividing\n\n\nIn mathematical operations involving significant figures, the answer is reported in such a way that it reflects the reliability of the least precise operation. Let's state that another way: a chain is no stronger than its weakest link. An answer is no more precise that the least precise number used to get the answer. Let's do it one more time: imagine a team race where you and your team must finish together. Who dictates the speed of the team? Of course, the slowest member of the team. Your answer cannot be MORE precise than the least precise measurement.  \n\n\nThe following rule applies for multiplication and division:\n\n\nThe LEAST number of significant figures in any number of the problem determines the number of significant figures in the answer.\n\n\nThis means you MUST know how to recognize significant figures in order to use this rule.\n\nExample #1: 2.5 x 3.42.\n\n\nThe answer to this problem would be 8.6 (which was rounded from the calculator reading of 8.55). Why?\n\n\n2.5 has two significant figures while 3.42 has three. Two significant figures is less precise than three, so the answer has two significant figures.",
