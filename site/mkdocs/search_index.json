You need to be careful when you work with numbers of different precisions.  \n\n\nFor instances, let's say you want to add a very precise number (i.e. 2004.214 g) to a number of low precision (i.e. 2000 g). How do you report the sum? \n\n\nBefre we can answer that, you need to understand Significant Digits.\n\n\nSignificant Digits\n\n\nThere are three rules on determining how many significant figures are in a number:\n\n\n\n\nNon-zero digits are always significant.  \n\n\nAny zeros between two significant digits are significant.  \n\n\nA final zero or trailing zeros in the decimal portion ONLY are significant.\n\n\n\n\nPlease remember that, in science, all numbers are based upon measurements (except for a very few that are defined). Since all measurements are uncertain, we must only use those numbers that are meaningful.  A common ruler cannot measure something to be 22.4072643 cm long. Not all of the digits have meaning (significance) and, therefore, should not be written down. In science, only the numbers that have significance (derived from measurement) are written.\n\n\nAdding and Subtracting\n\n\nFor addition and subtraction, look at the decimal portion (i.e., to the right of the decimal point) of the numbers ONLY. Here is what to do:\n\n\n1) Count the number of significant figures in the decimal portion of each number in the problem. (The digits to the left of the decimal place are not used to determine the number of decimal places in the final answer.)\n\n\n2) Add or subtract in the normal fashion.\n\n\n3) Round the answer to the LEAST number of places in the decimal portion of any number in the problem. \n\n\nExample: What is the sum of 2.25 and 0.025?\n\n\nWhile it is true the sum is 2.275, the value should reflect the reliability of the least precise operation. The answer should be reported as 2.28. \n\n\nMultiplying and Dividing\n\n\nIn mathematical operations involving significant figures, the answer is reported in such a way that it reflects the reliability of the least precise operation.

Any zeros between two significant digits are significant.    A final zero or trailing zeros in the decimal portion ONLY are significant.

Since all measurements are uncertain, we must only use those numbers that are meaningful.  A common ruler cannot measure something to be 22.4072643 cm long.
