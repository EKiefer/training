# Math

The type of math that is commonly used by plant staff includes basic statistics and algebra.

## Math Concepts  

There are several math concepts that operators should understand very well.

## Statistics  

Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In applying statistics to operations, we first need to select the applicable data and the select the statistical model.

In most cases, we select all of the measurements (i.e. chlorine residual) taken over the course of the day and run the basic analyses:

* Average (mean)  
* Max  
* Min  
* Range  

### Average

To determine the average, add up all of the values to determine the sum. Divide the sum of values by the number of values to get the average.

For instance, let's say you have the following chlorine residuals.

| residual (ppm)   |       |
| ---------------- |  -----|
| 2.1              |   value 1    |
| 2.5              |   value 2    |
| 2.3              |   value 3    |
| 2.7              |   value 4    |

2.1 + 2.5 + 2.3 + 2.7 = 9.6  
9.6 / 4 = 2.4  
*Average* = 2.4  

### Max  

The max is the greatest value in a collection of measurements.

### Min  

The min is the smallest value in a collection of measurements.

### Range  

Range is the difference between the max and the min.

For example, if the max = 2.7, and the min = 2.1, the range = 2.7 - 2.1 = 0.6.
