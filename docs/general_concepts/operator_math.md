# Math

The type of math that is commonly used by plant staff includes basic statistics and algebra.

## Math Concepts  

All operators need to understand basic math principles. Wihout exception, operators need to understand how the following math concepts:

* addition  
* subtraction  
* multiplication  
* division  
* fractions  
* unit analysis  
* conversion between fractions and decimal equivalent  
* rounding  

### Fractions  

There are many cases when operators need to work with fractions. For instance, when dealing with flow rates, operators need to remember that a flow rate such as 3.0 million gallons per day (MGD) can be written as:  

$$3.0 \frac {Million\,Gallons}{Day}$$  

This is useful to know if you are trying to add flow rates when units are not equivalent. For example, let's say you want to add 300 gallons per minute (GPM) to 3.0 MGD.  

$$300 \frac {Gallons}{Minute} + 3.0 \frac {Million\,Gallons}{Day}$$

As it is written, you cannot add these 2 fractions until you convert the units so that the units are the same.

#### Adding and Subtracting

When the units are the same, you can proceed with basic math operations. Let's assume you are able to get the units the same, now what? Consider the following expression:

$$\frac {1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}$$

In this example, you cannot proceed until you get convert the fraction(s) so that the denominator is the same. In case you are not familiar with the term "denominator," see the following figure.

$$\frac {numerator}{denominator}$$  

Getting back to our simple example, here is how you would proceed. 

1. Multiply the numerator and denominator of one of the fractions by the same amount to get an equivalent fraction--so that the equivalent fraction has the same denominator as the other fraction.
2. Add the numerators together.
3. Note: do NOT add the demoninators!


In this case:

$$\frac {1}{2} \times \left(\frac {2}{2}\right) = \frac{2}{4}$$

$$\frac {2}{4} + \frac {1}{4} = \frac {3}{4}$$

#### Multiplying and Dividing  

When multiplying and dividing, you proceed in the following manner:  

$$\frac {a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac {a \times c}{b \times d}$$  

$$\frac {a}{b} \div \frac{c}{d} = \frac {a}{b} \times \frac{d}{c} = \frac {a \times d}{b \times c}$$   

Using numbers instead of variable, consider the following expression:

$$\frac {2}{3} \times \frac{4}{7} = \frac {2 \times 4}{3 \times 7} = \frac {8}{21}$$

## Statistics  

Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In applying statistics to operations, we first need to select the applicable data and the select the statistical model.

In most cases, we select all of the measurements (i.e. chlorine residual) taken over the course of the day and run the basic analyses:

* Average (mean)  
* Max  
* Min  
* Range  

### Average

To determine the average, add up all of the values to determine the sum. Divide the sum of values by the number of samples to get the average.

For instance, let's say you have the following chlorine residuals.

$$(2.1, 2.5, 2.3, 2.7)$$

$$Sum\,of\,Values = 2.1 + 2.5 + 2.3 + 2.7 = 9.6$$

$$Number\,of\,Samples = 4$$

$$Average = \frac {Sum\,of\,Values}{Number\,of\,Samples} = \frac {9.6}{4} = 2.4$$

### Max  

The max is the greatest value in a collection of measurements.

$$Max = 2.7$$

### Min  

The min is the smallest value in a collection of measurements.

$$Min = 2.1$$

### Range  

Range is the difference between the max and the min.

Use the numbers in this section:

$$Range = Max - Min = 2.7 - 2.1 = 0.6$$
