## Chemistry  
Operators need to understand basic chemistry in order to be a successful operator. This section discusses some of the most important topics an operator must know.

## Acids & Bases  

Acids and bases are used in our treatment process. It is important to understand the basic properties of these chemicals so that you can safely handle them and predict how they will react with other chemicals.

Acids have a pH below 7. Bases have a pH above 7. Typically, most chemicals or solutions will have a pH within the range of 0 to 14.

Before we can discuss the meaning of pH, you must first understand some chemical properties of water (\(\ce{H2O}\)). One of them is that water is in equilibrium with hydronium and hydroxyl ions depicted in the reaction shown below.

$$\ce{H2O_{(l)} \rightleftharpoons H^+_{(aq)} + OH^{-}_{(aq)}}$$

Note: \(H^+\) is shorthand for \(\ce{H3O^+}\). The proton ion \(H^+\) associates with water molecule.

Water (on the left) is in equilibrium with \(H^+\) (hydronium) and \(OH^-\) (hydroxyl) ions. This means that water is dynamic; it is constantly converting between water and its parts. Other chemicals behave in the same manner.

You can measure how many \(H^+\) are in solution. This is typically done with several electrodes. In the probe shown in the image below, there is both a reference electrode and a pH electrode. The pH electrode has a glass bulb and is inserted into the solution that needs to be measured. The reference electrode is inside the body of the probe.

When you insert the pH probe into a solution, an electrial potential will develop across the pH electrode (outside electrode vs inside electrode). The more \(H^+\) ions in solution, the greater the potential. When you compare this potential to the potential of the reference electrode, you can determine how many \(H^+\) ions are in solution. As it turns out, the relationship between potential and pH is -59.18 mV/pH.

So, what exactly is pH? 

When you measure pH, you are measuring the concentration of \(H^+\) ions. However, there are a wide range of \(H^+\) ions that are typically observed. Instead of reporting a value of 0.0000007 moles / L or 0.1 moles / L of hydronium ions, is more convient to report and use the log of concentration using the following equation.

$$pH = -log\ce{[H^{+}]}$$

pH | \(\ce{[H^{+}]}\)
------------ | ------------- 
0 | 1 
1 | 0.1 
2 | 0.01
3 | 0.001
4 | 0.0001
5 | 0.00001
6 | 0.000001
7 | 0.0000001
8 | 0.00000001
9 | 0.000000001
10 | 0.0000000001
11 | 0.00000000001
12 | 0.000000000001
13 | 0.0000000000001
14 | 0.00000000000001

Increasing the pH by 1, decreases the concentration of hydronium ions by 10.

## Working with Numbers

Precision and accuracy are important concepts in chemistry. You need to be careful when you work with numbers of different precisions.  

For instances, let's say you want to add a very precise number (i.e. 2004.214 g) to a number of low precision (i.e. 2000 g). How do you report the sum? 

Before we can answer that, you need to understand significant digits.

### Significant Digits

There are three rules on determining how many significant figures are in a number:

* Non-zero digits are always significant.  
* Any zeros between two significant digits are significant.  
* A final zero or trailing zeros in the decimal portion ONLY are significant.

Please remember that, in science, all numbers are based upon measurements (except for a very few that are defined). Since all measurements are uncertain, we must only use those numbers that are meaningful.  A common ruler cannot measure something to be 22.4072643 cm long. Not all of the digits have meaning (significance) and, therefore, should not be written down. In science, only the numbers that have significance (derived from measurement) are written.

#### Adding and Subtracting

For addition and subtraction, look at the decimal portion (i.e., to the right of the decimal point) of the numbers ONLY. Here is what to do:

1) Count the number of significant figures in the decimal portion of each number in the problem. (The digits to the left of the decimal place are not used to determine the number of decimal places in the final answer.)

2) Add or subtract in the normal fashion.

3) Round the answer to the LEAST number of places in the decimal portion of any number in the problem. 

Example: What is the sum of 2.25 and 0.025?

While it is true the sum is 2.275, the value should reflect the reliability of the least precise operation. The answer should be reported as 2.28. 

#### Multiplying and Dividing

In mathematical operations involving significant figures, the answer is reported in such a way that it reflects the reliability of the least precise operation. Let's state that another way: a chain is no stronger than its weakest link. An answer is no more precise that the least precise number used to get the answer. Let's do it one more time: imagine a team race where you and your team must finish together. Who dictates the speed of the team? Of course, the slowest member of the team. Your answer cannot be MORE precise than the least precise measurement.  

The following rule applies for multiplication and division:

The LEAST number of significant figures in any number of the problem determines the number of significant figures in the answer.

This means you MUST know how to recognize significant figures in order to use this rule.  
Example #1: 2.5 x 3.42.

The answer to this problem would be 8.6 (which was rounded from the calculator reading of 8.55). Why?

2.5 has two significant figures while 3.42 has three. Two significant figures is less precise than three, so the answer has two significant figures.
